# PCBArtProjects
Various MakerQueen PCB Art Projects I've created over the years.  Each project contains the files for KiCAD and gerbers.  See summaries and images below: 

# Build An Open Future Keyring (2023)
A keyring with 'Build an Open Future' on the front and the MakerQueen logo on the reverse.  It's designed for creation with two-tone soldermask, with sakura pink background and some elements in purple.  Purple sections are located on the Eco layer. These were originally made my PCBBUY, using their Special Technology / Two color soldermask option. No functional circuit, artistic only.

# Party Button SAO (2021)
Created for the Linux Conference 2022, a SAO that lights up when the button is pressed.  Functional and artistic circuit.

# Woman in Space PCB Puzzle (2019)
This is an ultra large, A4 size piece of PCB Art.  At the time I was interested in creating something that had collectible parts that could be assembled into a frame.
Collect all the pieces and the whole thing would light up.  Each board has a piece of a large artwork on the front, and an amazing Australian
woman in STEM on the reverse.  Needless to say, the idea was scrapped.  I am still really proud of how the artwork turned out even if the concept was a flop. Not a functional circuit, artistic only.

# Sewable LEDs and Battery PCB
These were for a kit I delveloped but no longer make for wearable tech projects.  Snap out the pieces and sew the LEDs and battery pack with conductive thread to make a circuit.  Circuit works when the button is pressed.  Functional and artistic circuit.

# Colour Swatches ENIG, HASL and OSP
I made these to get an idea of what colours were possible with combinations of PCB layers and had these made in ENIG (Gold) HASL (Silver) and OSP (bronze) finishes.  I have my old SG / Spark Girls logo on the reverse.  A great PCB art reference or giveaway. Not a functional circuit, artistic only.
