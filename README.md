# PCBArtProjects
Various MakerQueen PCB Art Projects I've created over the years.  Each project contains the files for KiCAD and gerbers.  See summaries and images below: 

# Build An Open Future Keyring
A keyring with 'Build an Open Future' on the front and the MakerQueen logo on the reverse.  It's designed for creation with two-tone soldermask, with sakura pink background and some elements in purple.  Purple sections are located on the Eco layer. These were originally made my PCBBUY, using their Special Technology / Two color soldermask option.
